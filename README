This is a set of scripts that will be able to manipulate the Gnucash
XML files.

Targeted audience are people who want to interface the Gnucash XML file
with Perl.

It's pretty immature yet but it works for my own private accounting file
so I guess the most important features are supported.

To test, run:

	$ ./foo.pl <your-gnucash-xml-file>

and you'll get the same file reformatted on output. My gnucash can read
the script's output and it looks fine.

Tested with Gnucash 2.2.9.
